### What is Gin?

``
    Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API, but with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini. If you need smashing performance, get yourself some Gin.

### What is Gorm?

``
   GORM is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Golang. Let's start writing the CRUD API now. Create a new GO project and install related dependencies. We install GORM, Gin and Mysql by running the following command, in cmd or terminal that is already running in our project directory/folder.
